Text Summarization App
This is a simple text summarization application built with Streamlit and TensorFlow. It allows users to enter text and generate summaries using different models like T5, PEGASUS, and BART.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You will need the following libraries installed:

Streamlit
Transformers
TensorFlow
OpenAI API (for GPT-3)
You can install them by running:

pip install streamlit transformers tensorflow openai

You will also need to sign up for an OpenAI API key to use the GPT-3 model.

Installing
Clone the repository:
